#✈️ Airline-Flights-Data-Analysis-Visualization-SEABORN
This project explores a real-world airline flights dataset to uncover patterns in ticket pricing, travel demand, and time-to-departure effects. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, I visualized trends that could help travelers, analysts, or even airline companies make better decisions.

📂 Project Overview
Dataset: airlines_flights_data.csv

Language: Python

Libraries Used: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy

Notebook: Seaborn.ipynb (contains all analysis & visualizations)

🔍 Key Insights
How ticket prices vary as the departure date approaches.

Trends in demand across different airlines.

Patterns based on days left, seasonality, and other features.

Clear and colorful bar plots, scatter plots, and facet grids to highlight the story in the data.

🛠 Features in This Project
Data Cleaning & Preparation → Ensuring the dataset is analysis-ready.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Using Seaborn to create beautiful visualizations.

FacetGrid & Catplot Mastery → Breaking down trends by categories for deeper insight.

Interactive Plots → Designed for readability and engagement.

📊 Example Visualization
(Add a sample plot image here — GitHub README looks way better with it!)

🚀 Why This Project?
I built this notebook to improve my data storytelling skills and learn how to get the most out of Seaborn’s advanced plotting features. If you’re learning data visualization, this is a great reference for how to turn a dataset into an insightful visual narrative.
